This project is something Iâ€™m really proud. itâ€™s a Python-based tool I created to help Australian property investors (and curious data nerds like me ðŸ˜„) understand how resilient a propertyâ€™s cash flow is under real-world stress.

Instead of just looking at gross yield (which can be misleading), this metric â€” called Stress-Tested Cash-on-Cash (sCoC) â€” digs deeper by simulating things like interest rate hikes, maintenance costs, and vacancies. It gives you a much more honest picture of whether a property will still be cashflow-positive if things donâ€™t go perfectly.
